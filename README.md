# Use R for Epidemiologic Methods 1-3

This project aims to implement the labs of Epidemiologic Methods 1-3 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health using R. **Note: This project is not endorsed by anyone, including the course faculty.**

## Why R?

R is a free and open source alternative to Stata (and so much more).
