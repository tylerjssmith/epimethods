# Use R for Epidemiologic Methods 1-3

This project aims to implement the labs from Epidemiologic Methods 1-3 courses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health using R. **Note: This project is not endorsed by anyone, including the course faculty, not even me.** This is an opportunity for students interested in using R to do so and compare the results against what was obtained using Stata.

## Why R?

R is a free and open source alternative to Stata. It may be harder to learn, but ultimately it offers far more flexibility to scientists (in my opinion). It's also free, while Stata costs students ~ $200 per major release.

## Where can I learn more about R?

Roger Peng in the Department of Biostatistics teaches a course called Statistical Computing during first term. His slides from the course are available year-round [here](https://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776/index.html).
