# Use R for Epidemiologic Methods 1-3

This project aims to implement the labs from Epidemiologic Methods 1-3 courses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health using R. **Note: This project is not endorsed by course faculty. I do not vouch for any of the code or its output.** This is an opportunity for students interested in using R to do so and compare the results against what was obtained using Stata.

## Why use R?

R is a free and open source alternative to Stata and SAS. It may be harder to learn at first, but ultimately it offers far more flexibility to scientists (in my opinion). It's also free, while Stata and SAS cost much more.

## Where can I obtain R?

You can download R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). After you download R, you can download [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), which makes using R much easier. R and RStudio are free.

## Where can I learn more about R?

Roger Peng in the Department of Biostatistics teaches a course called Statistical Computing during first term. His slides from the course are available year-round [here](https://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776/index.html).

## How do I use this website?

GitHub is widely used by developers, but you do not need to know much about it to access the R scripts available on this website. You can navigate the folders above much as you would on your own computer. The scripts are organized by class (e.g., 753) and lab (e.g., Lab 1). 

If you do **not** want to learn more about GitHub, just click on the link to the script, click on the "Raw" button, and save the page (which should look like plain text) using the ".R" extension (e.g., 2020_Epi753_Lab1.R). If you **do** want to learn more about GitHub, see tutorials like [this one](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
